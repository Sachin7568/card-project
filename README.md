Welcome to the **Job Card Project**, a dynamic and visually appealing web application designed to showcase a list of mock job openings. It features modern, reusable cards that make browsing opportunities intuitive and clean.

Perfect for front-end demos or displaying structured data elegantly!

## ✨ Core Features

* **Intuitive Icons**: Uses the popular **Lucide React** library for sharp, clear icons (like the save bookmark!).
